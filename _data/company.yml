# This data file is used to represent your company page. It should not focus on
# a specific product, but present your whole company. The journalists won't,
# most of the time, know you or your studio.
#
# With this page, you will have an opportunity to show your people, your work,
# your history and your contributions in a standard format. This is not a
# replacement for your website, but a quick way for the press to know you faster.

# Fill the blanks while following this guide.
# Okay… ready? Let's do this.
# Name this file `company.yml`, and place it in the `_data` directory at the
# root of your site. It will be the root page of your presskit.
